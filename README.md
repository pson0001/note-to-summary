### **Backend API**: http://localhost:3000

### **Frontend 1: Metrics Dashboard**: http://localhost:3001

**Preview:** [Youtube link](https://youtu.be/ENKqulolQEE)

The **Metrics Dashboard** serves as a centralized interface for aggregating insights and data from multiple tools used during software development and experimentation.  
It supports **product managers, data analysts, designers**, and **senior stakeholders** who may not always have direct visibility into all aspects of a project.

Its primary goal is to reduce context-switching by consolidating relevant metrics, progress updates, and notes into a single, accessible view and helping teams make more informed and timely decisions.

### **Frontend 2: **Travel Notes App\*\*: http://localhost:3002

**Preview:** [Youtube link](https://youtu.be/APPjt_S3jQU)

The **Travel Notes App** is designed to simplify travel planning and journaling. It enables easy collection and organization of travel guides and recommendations from social media or other online sources.

Instead of manually entering each destination, users can **copy and paste** travel content directly into the app. The system automatically parses and structures this information into itineraries or travel notes, helping users plan trips more efficiently while maintaining a personal travel log for future visits.
